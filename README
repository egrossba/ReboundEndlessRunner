The technically interesting thing our game achieves is a unique take on physics
for endless runners. Our core mechanic idea was to have the player control a platform
or part of the environment, rather than the main character itself, and guide the
character through obstacles to safety. The implemented system lets you control a
butler who changes into 4 different forms that bounce the character high, low, right
and left. This mechanic was a challenge to achieve, but absolutely worth it.
